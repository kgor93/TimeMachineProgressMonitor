# TimeMachineScript
This script will give you the completion percentage of a running time machine backup (OS X only), difference since the last update, and average change.

It creates a folder called tmscript where it stores logs which it uses for calculations

#Installation
copy tmpct.sh to a local directory. Make sure tmutil is running by typing "tmutil status"

run the following command to set it up:

"chmod +x tmpct.sh"

#Usage
./tmpct [sleep time between iterations] KB|MB

ex. ./tmpct 5 MB

this updates every 5 seconds and uses Megabytes as the units. (KB will use Kilobytes).

#Output

```
